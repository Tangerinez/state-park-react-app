# state-park-react-app

This is my first web application built using React! This application allows the user to look up information about state parks
in Alabama! Features include:

- Search Bar functionality that displays a filtered search result listing out state parks
- Scrollable Google Maps interface (Google Maps API)
- Clickable markers on state park locations that displays hard-coded information (Google Maps API)

Technologies Used:
- Vanilla.js/React.js
- CSS3/Flexbox
- HTML5
- Google Maps API

KNOWN BUGS:
- Currently, the filtered list does NOT work. The intent is to have the user click on a state park in the filtered list, and for
the list to zoom in on that state park's location.
- Some spacing issues with text elements 
- The filtered list currently displays all of the state parks if the user inputs a value, and then deletes all of his/her inputs.
However, the reset button does eliminate this problem.

How to Run this application:
1. Fork and clone the repo from this page.
2. Open up node CLI, and go into the second "state-park-react-app" directory
3. In your terminal, type in ```npm start``` to initialize the application locally on your computer.
